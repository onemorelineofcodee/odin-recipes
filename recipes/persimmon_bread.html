    <p>
        Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.
