    <p>Creamy Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes</p>
    <p>These make-ahead mashed potatoes are rich, creamy, and smooth. You can do nearly everything up to two days ahead — a great option to give you a few extra hours on those big holidays. Adding butter after you reheat them makes them taste freshly mashed.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>3 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed but unpeeled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat half-and-half in the microwave until just warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Process unpeeled potatoes through a food mill into a medium bowl. (Or, using a potholder, peel and drop them into a bowl. Puree using a potato masher or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Stir in warm half-and-half and salt (or beat, if using a mixer) until smooth and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool, cover, and refrigerate potatoes in a microwave-safe, airtight container for up to 2 days.
        </li>
    </ul>
